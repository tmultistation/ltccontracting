# Phase Management Guidelines

## Phase 1: Template Reconfiguration
Current focus: Setting up the foundation for LTC Contracting website

### Phase 1 Validation Rules
1. Project Structure
   - All directories must match master plan structure
   - Each component directory must have index file
   - Type definitions must be complete

2. Development Environment
   - All configs must be properly set
   - Dependencies must be documented
   - Build process must be verified

3. Component Setup
   - Base components must be tested
   - Routing must be configured
   - Layouts must be responsive

### Phase Completion Checklist
```markdown
Before moving to next phase:
1. ✓ All Phase 1 tasks completed
2. ✓ No TypeScript errors
3. ✓ Build succeeds
4. ✓ Development server runs
5. ✓ Base components render
```

## Inter-Phase Dependencies
Track dependencies between phases:
```
Phase 1 ──┐
          ├─> Phase 2 ──┐
          │             ├─> Phase 4
Phase 3 ──┘             │
                        │
          Phase 5 <─────┘
```

## Quality Gates
Each phase must pass these gates:
1. Code Quality
   - No TypeScript errors
   - ESLint passes
   - Tests pass

2. Documentation
   - README updated
   - Comments complete
   - Types documented

3. Performance
   - Builds successfully
   - No console errors
